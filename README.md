# Pi Trebuchet
Elisabeth Scharf and Abigail Paquette

## Planning ##

**Goal:** Create the most automated whipper trebuchet possible. [What is a whipper trebuchet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gn2RGPqe_A&t=793s)

**Overview:**

How does a whipper trebuchet work?

Launch process

Tasks usually completed by a human:

- Put in place the counterweight
- Load the sling with the projectile
- Set the launch angle 
- Pull the release pin 

Tasks we would like automate:

- Setting the launch angle

- Pulling the release pin
  - Remote launch user interface
  - Pi's Flask webpage 
- Maybe:
  - Changing the weight in the counterweight

Constraints:

- It will be extremely difficult to reset the string on the trebuchet because the string will get caught
- Both emptying and refilling the counterweight would be extremely challenging
  - We have figured out how to lift marbles (which would be the weights) from the base of the treubuchet to the counterweight arm
  - The challenge is creating a container that can swing around without launching marbles, but be easily accessible for us to empty and refill according to the appropriate weight for the desired launch distance

**Engineering Process:**
- [x] Identify problem or goal 
- [ ] Identify resources and constraints
- [ ] Brainstorm ideas
- [ ] Pick a solution
- [ ] Develop an initial design (pencil and paper, CAD, etc.)
- [ ] Construct a prototype
- [ ] Test your design
- [ ] Refine/optimize your design
- [ ] Present finished product

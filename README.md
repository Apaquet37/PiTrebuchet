# Pi Trebuchet
Elisabeth Scharf and Abigail Paquette

## Planning ##
**Goal:** Create the most automated whipper trebuchet possible. [What is a whipper trebuchet?(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gn2RGPqe_A&t=793s)] 
**Overview/Outline:**
Tasks usually completed by a human:

- Put in place the counterweight
- Load the sling with the projectile
- Set the launch angle 
- Pull the release pin 

Tasks we would like automate:

- Setting the launch angle 
- Pulling the release pin 
- Maybe:
  - Changing the weight in the counterweight
